## Overview

This is the backend component of the application. We decided to use Angular because we had prior experience using it. Also the documentation is great, which can be really useful on complex scenarios.

In order to make the development process easier, we used some extra components.

First of all, we used PrimeNG which is an Angular UI Component, which delivers customizable components like buttons, grid, forms, menu, messages e.t.c.

Another useful component is Reactive Forms, which makes it easier to handle JSON.

For the security implementation on front-end part we used an open source project (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/angular-jwt)
